# NLP Fake News Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting **fake news** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The dataset was sourced from **Kaggle**, and various machine learning models were implemented to classify news as real or fake.

---

## 1. Dataset
The dataset used for this project was obtained from **Kaggle** and contains labeled news articles categorized as either **fake** or **real**. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify news articles based on their textual content.

## 2. Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for machine learning, the following preprocessing steps were performed:
- **Tokenization** â€“ Splitting text into individual words
- **Stopword Removal** â€“ Removing common words that do not add much meaning
- **Stemming/Lemmatization** â€“ Converting words to their root form
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** â€“ Converting text into numerical features

## 3. Model Implementation
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated for fake news detection:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **NaÃ¯ve Bayes Classifier**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Deep Learning (LSTM-based model)**

## 4. Feature Selection & Model Performance
Each model was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The **confusion matrix** and **ROC curve** were used to assess classification performance.
